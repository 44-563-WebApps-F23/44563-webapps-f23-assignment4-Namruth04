<p class="direction">_[looking at her watch]_.</p>
<p class="speech">Not yet—and the time is nearly up. If only he does not—.</p>
<p class="direction">_[Listens again.]_</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, there he is.</p>
<p class="direction">_[Goes into the hall and opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the stairs. She whispers.]_</p>
<p class="speech">Come in.There is no one here.</p>

<h4 class="KROGSTAD">KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p class="direction">_[in the doorway]_.</p> 
<p class="speech">I found a note from you at home. What does this mean?</p>

<h4 class="MRSLINDE">MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p class="speech">It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.</p>

<h4 class="KROGSTAD">KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p class="speech">Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?</p>

<h4 class="MRSLINDE">MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p class="speech">It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers are at the dance upstairs.</p>

<h4 class="KROGSTAD">KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p class="direction">_[coming into the room]_.</p> 
<p class="speech">Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?</p>

<h4 class="MRSLINDE">MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p class="speech">Yes, why not?</p>

<h4 class="KROGSTAD">KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p class="speech">Certainly—why not?</p>

<h4 class="MRSLINDE">MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p class="speech">Now, Nils, let us have a talk.</p>

<h4 class="KROGSTAD">KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p class="speech">Can we two have anything to talk about?</p>

<h4 class="MRSLINDE">MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p class="speech">We have a great deal to talk about.</p>

<h4 class="KROGSTAD">KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p class="speech">I shouldn’t have thought so.</p>

<h4 class="MRSLINDE">MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p class="speech">No, you have never properly understood me.</p>

<h4 class="KROGSTAD">KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p class="speech">Was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all the world—a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance turns up?</p>
