<h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p>_[looking at her watch]_.</p>
<p>Not yet—and the time is nearly up. If only he does not—.</p>
<p>_[Listens again.]_</p>
<p>Ah, there he is.</p>
<p>_[Goes into the hall and opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the stairs. She whispers.]_</p>
<p>Come in.There is no one here.</p>

<h4>KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p>_[in the doorway]_.</p> 
<p>I found a note from you at home. What does this mean?</p>

<h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p>It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.</p>

<h4>KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p>Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?</p>

<h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p>It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers are at the dance upstairs.</p>

<h4>KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p>_[coming into the room]_.</p> 
<p>Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?</p>

<h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p>Yes, why not?</p>

<h4>KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p>Certainly—why not?</p>

<h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p>Now, Nils, let us have a talk.</p>

<h4>KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p>Can we two have anything to talk about?</p>

<h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p>We have a great deal to talk about.</p>

<h4>KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p>I shouldn’t have thought so.</p>

<h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
<p>No, you have never properly understood me.</p>

<h4>KROGSTAD.</h4>
<p>Was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all the world—a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance turns up?</p>
